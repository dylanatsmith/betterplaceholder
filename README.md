Builds on the fakeimg.pl service.

## Local development

### SCSS

Almost all of the styles come from [Primer CSS](https://primer.style/css) utility classes. There is some custom CSS that gets compiled with Sass along with the third-party dependencies.

1. Install Sass globally: `npm install -g sass` or `brew install sass/sass/sass`
2. Compile manually after changes: `sass scss/main.scss css/main.css`

### JS

V1 of this project was built on CodeKit but when I did V2 I just smashed everything into main.js.
